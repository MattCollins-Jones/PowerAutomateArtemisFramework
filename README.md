# The Power Automate Artemis Framework

The Power Automate Artemis Framework, is designed to help builders of Cloud Flows; create flows in a supportable manner, building them quickly and efficiently, in a standardised way. Consistency is key when performing rapid app and automation development, allowing yourself and others understand how something has been built at a glance, extend/alter quickly, following best practices.

# Artemis
Artemis is the greek god of hunting or hunters, often times pictured with a bow and arrow. The Power Automate Icon looks like an arrow head and the idea of being precise or going straight to the source was the idea behind the name.


# Collaborators
This framework is derived from years of building flows with colleagues, gaining feedback, discussing the best practices for implementation. These people are too many to name, but the one who stands out as instrumental in these is Andrew Wolfe.

Getting ideas and feedback from others building flows is invaluable, not only does a healthy discussion on best practices allow us to refine these, but it help highlight areas people might not consider. Several people have helped in shaping this framework into what it is today:

* Jerry Weinstock
* Matt Weston
* Sara Lagerquist
* Paul Culmsee 
* Alex McLachlan
* Keith Whatling
* Matt Devaney
* Ahmad Najjar
* Pieter Veenstra
